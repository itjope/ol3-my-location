Development
-----

* `npm start` - Spins up webpack-dev-server server to serve your app at `localhost:9000`.
* `npm run compile` - Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).
* `npm run test` - Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.
* `npm run test:dev` - Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.
* `npm run deploy`- Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.
